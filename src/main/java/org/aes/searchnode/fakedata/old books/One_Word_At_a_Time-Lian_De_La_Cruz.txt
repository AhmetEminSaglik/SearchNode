Virtuous



Overlooking the quiet town of Hialeah, Margaret Watkins joined Hector Romanov in the balcony of one of the cheerless rooms of the small inn. She greeted him and helped herself to some ice and scotch from the small decanter on the balcony's table after taking a seat.

"I apologize for the last minute summoning. The last time we spoke, well," Margaret

tipped the tumbler and closed her eyes as the liquid copper hit her lips. "It was quite unsettling.

What were you trying to say, Romanov, that you can't do it?" The light of the small lamp gleamed off the buckle in her heel when she shifted one leg over the other. "I'd assumed a man with your... credentials would be able to get the job done in no time. I mean, it's not like I don't pay you well, don't I?" She smiled before taking a dainty sip and peered at Romanov from the rim of her glass.

"You do, Mrs. Watkins. It-It's not that." Romanov fumbled inside his jacket and produced a handkerchief which he used to dab at the perspiration, making a small comment about the Florida heat, and cleared his throat. "W-We just haven't been able to track him down. I still have my men set up in the Maldives. If your husband so much as sneezes, we will find him."

Romanov tugged at his shirt's collar and eyed the spare tumbler next to the decanter.

"Is that so?" Fixing her gaze on the distant town, Margaret twirled her scotch. A small ripple of satisfaction tried her lips as she heard over the clinking ice the sound of Romanov's slacks rustling against the seat's fabric in his weak attempts to find a comfortable position.

Setting her drink down on the small table, a gust of wind brought a fresh respite from the perpetual odor of stale cigarettes. She could see his eyes follow her every move like a mouse who strayed too close to a cat.

"Do you see that chair over there?" she asked. She gestured to the odd wooden ensemble by the kitchenette. "I chose this fine establishment as our meeting location because of it. We had one just like it back in Tahoe." She searched his unchanging expression. "And do you know what happened in Tahoe, Mr. Romanov?" Shifting her legs again, she ran her hands up her ankles and followed Romanov's gaze as her fingers traced the welts in her skin. "I did a lot of waiting. They say patience is a virtue and I deemed myself a virtuous woman during my time in Tahoe. Even today, I am still waiting."

"Ma'am, I promise we will find him. We're canvasing the area as we speak"

Their conversation was interrupted by the shrill sound of the telephone unit in the room.

Margaret got up and walked over to answer.

"Yes?" She listened to the receiver and made a sound of surprise. "How far? I see... yes,

I do. Immediately. Get on it." She ended the call and dialed another number. "Code orange," was all she said before hanging up. Turning her gaze to her conversation partner she asked, "Mr. Romanov, how long have you been working for my husband?"

"Ma'am?" Romanovs eyes danced be ween the woman and the phone. Margaret walked over to the door and peered through the peephole. A small smile tugged at her perfect lips as she unlocked the door.

"I assume a very long time since you're willing to aid him even after the small fortune I've paid for your services."

Romanov shot up from his seat and walked into the room. "I don't know what you mean. I'm doing as you've asked. I'm working on what you're paying me for. I will find your husband!" Each sentence rose as the alarm trickled into his voice. Romanov looked around the room and tugged at his collar.

"No need, Mr. Romanov. He's already been found." Margaret opened the door and ushered in two burly men dressed in black, carrying what seemed to be a medical bag. "My men spotted him in one of your safe houses quite cozy and very, very, very far away from the Maldives, as you've led me to believe is his current location." With perturbing strength, heavy feet stomped on the carpet as the men grabbed Romanov by the arms and wrestled him into the chair with rope and duct tape.

"What? No! It's a set up! Can't you see?" Margaret grimaced at the volume of his voice and twirled her hand. As a result, one of her men put a wire around Romanov's throat and pulled back.

"Please be civilized, Hector. I don't want to bother the other guests." Romanov pleaded with Margaret who sat by the edge of the bed after having closed the other door and the heavy drapes. "I didn't know he was there! My spies told me he was in the Maldives! I swear!"

"Hard to believe that a man such as yourself can't even realize that his target was right under his nose. I'm sorry, Mr. Romanov, but I just can't believe that. Such gross miscalculation. Gentlemen."

She signaled at the two brutes who proceeded to open the bag and pull out strange hardware. Romanov's breath became shallow and quick as he eyed what the men were doing.

Once again, he tried to reason with Margaret. Her eyes rolled skyward and the men placed a large piece of duct tape over his lips, effectively muffling his screams.

"Believe it or not, Mr. Romanov, I'm quite acquainted with lies. Heaven knows all the ones I had to tell my husband." She walked over to him. Her small nose wrinkled in anger, giving away her calm demeanor. "Only the worst got me in that chair you're sitting on now."

She nodded at one of the guards who promptly exited the room to stand sentry. Romanov frantically shook his head. You could hear his pleading and sobs as tears trickled over the duct tape but Margaret was hearing none of it. "Perhaps it's time I showed you what happened in Tahoe, Mr. Romanov. I think it's high time we found out just how virtuous are you."





Cecile



Have you ever had to face someone you loved and had to tell them something you knew would shatter their hearts into a million small pieces?

At the very end, I never expected to feel this way. It is true that I've been gearing myself up for months now, ticking items off the list one by one and yet I thought I'd be ready... but I am not.

As I made my way down the dreary hallway, my steps grew heavier. The weight of death loomed over me like a sign from God. The hallway isn't very long and yet I find no matter how many steps I take, I don't get any closer to her door. A younger version of myself walks past me with her dad in tow. He lugs an armful of presents with a smile on his face. Christmas is meant for happiness, for family, for giving. Not for what I'm about to do. I've already taken everything from her. The only thing she has left is hope and that's what I'm here for tonight. I will be the death of her.

I had never been able to appreciate everything she had done for me. After my parents passed away, grief consumed me and I just wanted to get away. But she'd have none of it. All those evenings when I'd come home bruised and bloodied, she'd patch me up and feed me. She never asked me questions. Not who or what or why or how. When I came through that door and she'd see me, she would just grab the first aid kit and tell me dinner was in the oven. Maybe it was pity or maybe she was kind like that but when I finally did disappear I essentially spat all that right back in her face. She truly deserved none of it.

And now, 10 years later, with nothing to my name except stage 4 terminal cancer, I am making my way up to her door with a box of chocolate truffles, her favorite, to tell her that I'm dying. After everything I've been through, I imagine I've become fairly acquainted with grief and its stages. Yet I try to imagine how she'll react. Maybe she'll open the door and not ask questions. She'll give me some food and smile at me. But no. Too much time has passed and too much has happened. She'll cry. It seems the only logical response. I'd never seen her cry. And here I was about to make that happen for her.

Finally reaching the door, I raise my free hand and knock three times.

"Aunt Cecile?" There was silence from the other side of the door. I knock again. "Cecile it's me, auntie." Nothing. I sigh, picturing her inside the apartment with her eyes wide in surprise, maybe unable to believe that it's really me. "It really is me, auntie." I feel the knot on my throat and my eyes burn with unshed tears. "I am so so sorry... about everything." Still no response.

I carried on. "I'm sorry I never appreciated everything you did for me. I'm sorry I wasn't good for you. I'm sorry I disappeared. I'm sorry I never called. I'm sorry for the ten years of silence. You deserved so much more and I am so sorry, auntie." I clenched my fist and wiped the radioactive tears and snot from my face. "Please, open the door..."

After a pause, I heard bolts and latches click undone. My heart quickened as I got one lock closer to her. I took a deep breath, took off my hat, and placed the bag on the floor, ready to be in her arms. The doorknob twisted and the door pulled inwards. "Aunt Cecile"

A beautiful, elderly black woman in a wheelchair sat before me. Her hair was in a bonnet and the soft pink crocheted shawl she held wrapped tightly over her nightgown. Her sad eyes regarded me with the intensity I had been feeling since I stepped out of the raggedy elevator.

But she was not aunt Cecile.

"I'm sorry, child," her liquid copper voice said. "I believe Cecile was the previous tenant... She passed away around 9 years ago."

Her words drifted into a sharp ring in my ear. I felt the air escape my lungs as if my poisonous body was no longer a pleasant place to be in. As if the prospect of her forgiveness was what kept me up, I crumbled to my knees. And I cried. I cried heat on my icy skin.

Have you ever had to face someone you loved only to have your heart shattered into a million small pieces?





Divorcing in the 16th Century



His majesty King Henry Tudor of England, VIII of his name, slammed the papers against the table and said, "We have a problem. I've been told by his holiness, the Pope, that I, in fact, cannot divorce my pious wife, Catherine, who, according to him, has done no wrong. Obviously, he would not be able to understand the wrong that Catherine has done to England because he does not have to concern himself with heirs or wives for that matter."

He looked at the small assembly and frowned. To his left, sat Chancellor Thomas Wolsey and to his right, sat the young Anne Boleyn. "I propose we put up signs all over the city that ridicule the pope and his rule. We will make doodles of him with a big head and an ugly nose.

And, what else, we will charge five pounds to anyone who is loyal to him rather than me!

Anything slanderous you can come up with. That ought to sway him." Henry huffed from where he stood by the head of the table and met Thomas' concerned gaze.

"Doodles, your grace?" asked Thomas.

"Doodles!"

"But, your grace, we've already done that." Thomas said. "To no avail, as the pope is still deliberating."

"Well, then make him deliberate faster. I need solutions, Thomas. Has anybody got any ideas? I truly cannot go on like this. Catherine is an absolute bore. Do you know what she said to me the other day? She said 'Oh my beloved husband, we should go to Spain to visit my dear nephew.' Good grief, woman! Every Englishman, from the lads guarding the Scottish border to the skulls in the catacombs, knows that there is absolutely nothing more dreadful than Spain. It's just a bunch of bulls and tasteless hats! Am I wrong, Thomas?"

Caught off guard, Wolsey seemed to shrink into his robes with every word. "I-I-I-I'm sorry, your grace, what was that?"

"The hats, Thomas! Are they or are they not tasteless?" Henry threw his arms in the air and began to pace.

"Absolutely, your grace. They're just absolutely dreadful."

"Right they are! So, any ideas?" His eyes danced between those of the two that he knew, both biblically and executively.

"If I may, your grace?" Takin advantage of the pause, the beautiful Anne spoke up from her seat. "I believe I have a solution to our predicament. However, it is rather unorthodox and, to be frank, could go against the views of some in this room." Thomas and Henry exchanged looks.

Henry gestured with his arm for Anne to proceed.

"Your grace," Thomas chimed in. "I highly advise against heeding anything the Lady Boleyn has to say. She's no authority in ecclesiastical matters. Please, allow me some more time. I will get the pope's approval."

"Thomas, everyone everywhere knows something that you don't. How can you disregard Lady Boleyn's argument which you've not heard? Anne dearest, please, carry on."

Anne smiled and pulled from her handbag a tattered leather-bound book. "I have here a book written by William Tyndale. He-"

"William Tyndale?" exclaimed Thomas as he took the book Anne held from across the table. "This book is banned! It is forbidden! How did you get your hands on this? Your grace, you couldn't possibly consider the words of a heretic." Anne snatched the book back. "He is no heretic! He is an educated man who realized the Roman Catholic Church had been poisoned by the greed and desires of men. He advocates for the return of true religion, one between man and God rather than man, church, and God. It's all there in his book."

"Your grace, please. Clearly this would never hold up in parliament. I'm sure the pope is nearing his decision and it will be in our favor. All we need do is wait."

"Thomas, I swear to God, interrupt Lady Boleyn one more time and it's off with you."

Henry ran his index finger across his neck for emphasis and frowned. Turning his attention back to Anne, he asked, "what exactly are you suggesting, my sweet Anne?"

"Your grace, simply put, a man of your stature and wisdom would want what's best for England, would he not?" After seeing Henry nod, Anne continued saying, "you'd want God on your side and what better way than to bring your subjects closer to Him? You're anointed by God. If you took matters into your own hands, it would please the Lord and he'd be on your side.

Maybe that's why you've not had sons. Maybe it's delayed gratification as He's waiting for you to bring his people back, like Abraham, and this is your promised land."

"Your grace," interrupted a now-visibly-perspiring Thomas, "you can't believe this-"

"Shush, Thomas, I'm thinking."

"It's all in the book, your grace." Anne added.

After a brief pause, Henry grinned. "Anne, my dear, I should need to deliberate further on this information you've brought for me." He twirled his hand in the air as a form of elaboration.

"I believe what you say is accurate. I should like to read more of what this Tyndale has to say so I can build my case for parliament. I already have an idea of what I will do."

"And what is that?"

"It is no lie that the Roman Catholic Church has been poisoned by the worldly desires of the men that lead it and I should have no hand in allowing that vice to poison England as well.

"It's my utmost sacred duty to disengage England from such foulness. So, I'll make my own church!" And then no one will be able to tell me who I can and can't divorce, Henry added to himself. "I'll call it Henry's Epic Inquisition! Yes... yes, I like the sound of that."

"But, your grace," Thomas said. "we can't call it that." Not to mention that parliament would never agree.

"Then call it The bloody Church of England! I don't care! Get me a quill and parchment. Anne, baby, pack your things. Our honeymoon is afoot!"





Shan's Box



One morning, Shan was about to take a sip from her fresh-squeezed Floridian orange juice when a hideously synthetic sound broke the silence of her suburban home. The sound made the hairs on her neck bristle. It sounded nothing like what the Home Depot employee described.

"For the price you're looking for, it sounds like the chirp of a bird" he'd said with a toofriendly smile.

She should change it, she mused. Maybe I'll even report the condescending employee to his superior. Maybe they'll get me a better one for free as an apology. The banshee-wail of her current one screeched again. She frowned.

"I pay my taxes. I pay for my own health insurance. I don't take anything from nobody. The least I ask is to enjoy my fresh-squeezed Floridian orange juice peacefully!"

It rang again.

"Damn it all!" She got up from her spot near the kitchen's island and marched to the front door. Through the peephole she saw her fish-eyed neighborhood and nothing else. She undid the locks and disabled the alarm as she muttered depthless threats. She pulled the door open and found a box, to her surprise. Shan looked around again. After a beat, she crouched and gathered the box in her arms. Her curiosity piqued, she took it inside.

Setting the box on her kitchen island, Shan took one more sip of her juice and opened the box. It was brown and the flaps were sealed with tape which she did apart with her keys. Finally folding it open, she gasped.

Inside was a black void, unreal, like an optical illusion. Shaking, she felt a gust of wind against her skin. Her heart began to race as her mind tried to make sense of this but Shan could not pull away. She peered in closer and closer until she fell into the box.

Shan yelled and turned around as she fell through the opening of the box. She saw her kitchen light draw further and further away. The poor woman flailed her arms helplessly trying to find footing or something to hold on to but there was nothing around her but darkness. She thrashed and yelled herself hoarse until she could no more and fainted.

By the time she came to, who knew how much time had passed? Shan was still falling.

She tried calling for help but no one answered. It could have been hours or days or perhaps even years. The hole from which she came through was a faint star now. Shan had given up on ever returning to her normal life. She longed for her fresh-squeezed Floridian orange juice and her banshee wail doorbell. Tears streaked from her eyes as she sobbed. Would she die there? Or would it be never-ending falling?

"Do you truly repent?"

Shan looked around unsure of what had spoken. Next to her, a shape materialized. It was a woman with flowing hair and a sad face.

"Who are you?"

"I asked, do you truly repent?"

"Repent for what?" Just like that, the woman disappeared again.

"Wait! Wait! Come back! I-I repent! Please, I repent! Who are you?"

"It's a lovely doorbell." Shan heard her all around but didn't see her. A loud screech pierced the silence. Shan closed her eyes and covered her ears at the thunderous sound of her doorbell. "You should learn to love it."

"I do! I love it! Please, I repent!"

The sound stopped. When Shan opened her eyes, the woman was gone. A light shone from behind Shan and she turned around to see her kitchen light come closer. She braced for the impact. Her heart was going a mile a minute. Her body tumbled through the hole and into her island's chair. Her breathing was labored and she opened her eyes to her familiar kitchen. How long has it been? The clock on the wall showed half past seven and a bright sun shone through the windows. In front of her, the box sat sealed. Perplexed and confused, Shan burst into tears. She began running her hands over her face and body, checking to see if she was real, if this was real.

When she finally settled, she got up to get rid of the cursed box when the doorbell rang. It was a beautiful sound, absolutely perfect yet unchanged.

Shan made her way to the door with short breaths, hearing her blood rushing. The locks were undone so she just opened it.

A beautiful woman with flowing hair smiled broadly. She extended her arms and bent her fingers twice.

"I'm here for my box."
